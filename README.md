## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a friendly neighborhood solo coder whoâ€™s okayish at Python and currently stumbling through Java for my AP course. Think of me as the "random person who canâ€™t do anything useful" but is exceptionally good at turning simple tasks into complex disasters.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on pretending to learn Java. My code might compileâ€¦ eventually once I add that semicolon.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Java for my AP course and still trying to figure out why Python syntax isnâ€™t universally adopted. My Python skills are like a myth at this point.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, Python, or why my code frequently looks like it was written by a sleep-deprived squirrel!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Insert contact info hereâ€”if you can find it... or just try sending it via smoke signals?]
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
